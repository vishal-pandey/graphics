JavaScript Emplementation of Computer Graphics Algorithm

Computer graphics is a subject taught us in 5th semester of our B.tech computer science course
All Algorithms of the subject are generally impleted in c or c++ language but for a change 
I implemented all these algorithms in javascript so that it become easy to illustrate and 
demonstrate of the working of these algorithms

Algorithms implemented here are

1. Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)
2. Translation of point
3. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clippings
4. Scaling Of A Quardilateral
5. Reflection Of A Quardilateral
6. Shear - X
7. Rotation Of A Point

There is separate page for each algorithm and the code used is displayed on the page along with online resource of the 
description of these algorithms
